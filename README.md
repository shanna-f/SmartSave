## 1. Project Context  
This team project ran for **6 weeks** from July 12 - Aug 23, 2025.
It was hosted by *The Business Analysis Circle*.  

Our team was made up of 7 people in multiple countries, and we were all playing business analyst roles.

### 🎯 Objective

## 3. My Approach & Contributions 

- 📊 **Tracking**: Built an Excel status tracker (deliverables, due dates, owners, progress).  
- 📚 **Research**: Explored templates & created custom docs (BRD, SRS).  
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Used WhatsApp for async updates & support (since team availability varied).  
- 💡 **AI Support**: Leveraged ChatGPT to speed up template creation & analysis.  
- 📌 **Preparation**: Planned agendas, set objectives for meetings, and facilitated discussions.
- 📑 **Requirements**: Requirements breakdown from business → user → system.
- 🧩 **Traceability**: Ensured traceability across deliverables (BRD → URD → SRS).
- 🖼️ **Visuals**: Created visuals (flows, journeys, mockups) that clarified user needs and solutions.
