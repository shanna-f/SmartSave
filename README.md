### Week 6: Final Wrap-up  
- Presented final deliverables & outcomes  
- Reflected on lessons learned as a team

## My Approach  

- 📊 **Tracking**: Built an Excel status tracker (deliverables, due dates, owners, progress).  
- 📚 **Research**: Explored templates & created custom docs (URD, SRS).  
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Used WhatsApp for async updates & support (since team availability varied).  
- 💡 **AI Support**: Leveraged ChatGPT to speed up template creation & analysis.  
- 📌 **Preparation**: Planned agendas, set objectives for meetings, and facilitated discussions.
